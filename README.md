🚀 Why This Project Matters

Endometriosis is under-researched and under-recognized in both healthcare and the workplace. By visualizing this data:
•	Companies can better understand hidden productivity costs.
•	Policymakers can push for earlier detection and treatment.
•	Data professionals can see the intersection of analytics + advocacy.

🔮 Next Steps
•	Add live data connection (Power BI refresh).
•	Expand visuals into workplace-specific insights.
•	Explore text analytics on open-ended survey responses.
